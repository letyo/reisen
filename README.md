This is a website of an imaginary tourist agency. My goal was here rather the front-end, but I would liked to make a login page too.

As always I just wanted to try out some methods to learn, how these really work. There is for example a login/reg built in a modal (with check for bruteforce, and it sends an email, if the password had been typed in several times incorrect, and stay loged in with cookie), lightbox using JavaScript, a loader and a jump-to-the-top button. And I used parallax on the whole website.
